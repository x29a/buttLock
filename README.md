Watchapp for Pebble to lock the buttons

This Watchapp locks all buttons (ignores their presses).

In order to exit the app, long press the back (upper left) button.

Get it at the official Pebble AppStore (https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54fad867c2eca30d2a000016).

Unfortunately, it is not possible to override the long press back event, otherwise it would be possible to create some code (e.g. left-right-left) to unlock the watch.

The display is inspired by the Simplicity Watchface (https://github.com/pebble/pebble-sdk-examples/tree/master/watchfaces/simplicity) and the Button Lock Watchapp (https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/543f02a145b1f75605000010).

Compilation was done via CloudPebble (https://cloudpebble.net/).
